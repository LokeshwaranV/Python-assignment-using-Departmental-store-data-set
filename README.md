# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - README

## Problem Statement

## Introduction

You have been hired as the Tech Lead for a Software company that builds the technology behind departmental stores such as Walmart and Amazon Fresh. Your job is to use your programming knowledge to automate some of the tasks that occur in these stores. Some of these tasks include automating the billing process, building an inventory management system, and finding insights on product sales. This will help increase the efficiency at which your departmental store clients function.

Understanding the Data
You have two types of data available. The first is price data, which is available in a Python data structure called a dictionary. This dictionary has been named item_dict, and it stores the price of each item that is available in the store.

Q1. Adding and Removing Items

Based on customer demand, items keep changing in the store. Your first task is to create a function that lets the admin add or remove items from the store directory (Cost dictionary).

Task List:

Find how many unique items are present in the data?

Find the total number of transactions?

Add items, try adding the item “banana” in stores. The cost of this item is $5.

Remove an item: for example, if the customers at Walmart do not seem to be purchasing “banana,” and the store decides to discontinue this item.


Q2. Billing System

Once a customer has completed shopping, they need to be billed for the total amount of all the items. This can be done automatically by swiping each item’s barcode on a checkout system.

Task List:

Write the code to find the price of an item from the cost dictionary

Find the price of salmon from the cost dictionary

Write a code that helps the administrator find any particular transaction in the sequence

Find the total cost of the ninth transaction from the array of transactions

Find the final price of the second transaction after applicable taxes have been implemented

Q3. Inventory Management System
There is always a flow of items in and out of stores, which need to be tracked so that the store can place an order in case an item is running out of stock.

Task List:

What is the data structure that can be used to count the frequency of items purchased?

Create a frequency counter to count the number of items

A new transaction has just been made. Update the frequency counter to reflect this new transaction

Q4. Discount Week for Christmas
Walmart is running a discount week for Christmas! The sales manager has decided to keep a 20% discount on the top three selling items.

Task List:

What is the top-selling item?

Sort the frequency counter dictionary by the value count (or the number of items). Sort the frequency counter using provided sorting algorithms and measure the time taken by each algorithm.

Sorting Algorithms and Time Taken

Merge <br>
Insertion <br>
Selection

Rank the sorting algorithms in order of the time they take to sort items.
